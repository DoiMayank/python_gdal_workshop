# Intro to Python

Introduction to the use of Python for data science



## Why Python

* Python has a syntax that is efficient, somewhat tries to resemble natural language, which allows for ease of use. (when compared to other languages)
* With itâ€™s popularity, many other popular scientific software libraries were implemented:
  * Numpy - To support numeric analysis as naturally as Matlab does
  * Matplotlib - Similar plotting functionality to Matlab
  * Pandas - Data frame and associated manipulations (similar to R)
  * sckikit-learn - Machine Learning algorithms (similar to caret in R)
  * IPython/Jupyter - Notebook concept (similar to Mathematica/Sage)
* There are better tools for specific use cases, but for general purpose programming, Python is preferred.
* Large community, many resources!



## Why not use ArcMap, QGIS, PCI?

* Writing a workflow as a program allows for pushing the compute time to the cloud.
* To scale (distribute) your workflow across a very large dataset. 
* Python and third party libraries are open source, no expensive enterprise licensing.
